It also means the website is effectively designed in the way that attracts a great number of visitors to take the desired action, which, for most eCommerce sites, is to buy a product or service. As a result, the more visitors are converted into customers, the more revenue for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While marketing strategies, such as SEO, Google ads, social marketing, try to drive more traffic to your website, conversion optimization plans play an important role in turning your site visitors into customers.<\/span><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To improve conversion rate on your website requires thorough research about user behavior when visitors explore your website. That said, there are tactics that encourage more and more visitors to become your loyal customers. This article will outline 10 tips you can carry out to optimize conversion rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. A\/B testing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8307\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/split-testing.jpg\" alt=\"conversion rates - A\/B testing\" width=\"768\" height=\"401\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A\/B testing (split testing) is the method that you create different versions of your page with some tweaks and test to see which works better with higher conversion rates. Due to the fact that your audience is unique, what you think works well might turn to be a bad choice when it comes to your audience. Therefore, the best way to figure out what works well and what needs further improvement is to do A\/B testing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To split testing, you can use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/1745152?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Content Experiments<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Google Analytics which is a free and easy to use tool.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8306\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/split-testing-in-Google-Analytics.jpg\" alt=\"conversion rates - A\/B testing\" width=\"600\" height=\"561\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, set up your goal and the percentage of traffic you want to send to experiment. Then input the destination URLs of the original page you want to test and of other variations. You will be given an experiment code to add to your original page. When all is setup, you\u2019re ready to run start the testing and see which is performing better.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Create urgency for immediate action<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urgency notifications like \u201cThere\u2019re only 3 items left\u201d or \u201cThe last day to get the discount\u201d have proved to be effective in urging people to buy right away. When there\u2019s a specific deadline or scarcity for special offers, people will tend not to delay but take the buying process immediately for they don\u2019t want to miss out the chance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, be careful to choose a proper type of urgency depending on your products or services. For example, if you offer digital products which never run out of stock, using the statement saying something like \u201c5 items left in stock\u201d is not gonna work and can cause reverse effect to your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Show the benefits<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8303\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/benefits.png\" alt=\"conversion rates - show the benefits\" width=\"799\" height=\"329\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A landing page that sells has not only good design but also excellent contents. Contents are what your customers will read and are your opportunity to persuade people why they should choose your products over the ones from other competitors. So, what are the key takeaways to create great contents for your website? Here are some:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Show value proposition:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What is value proposition? It is a statement of value you will give your customers. It convinces users how your products better solve and improve customers\u2019 problems than similar offerings. Having a specific value proposition will help differentiate your company from other competitors, show your uniqueness and strengths. Also, visitors will find it easier to understand your company, your products, and to determine how your offerings will help them improve the situations.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Great copy to make it easy to read:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Once you have set up your value proposition, deliver it in a way that all visitors can read it and understand easily. This is very important as they are your potential customers and the target you want to communicate with. If your messages are written in terminological terms that only economy majored people can understand, you have failed in delivering your values to a lot of potential customers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>More benefits, fewer features:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Most importantly, people buy why you do it, not what you do it. This is consistent with the value proposition focus. Your customers are more interested in the benefits your products offer than the features. Let\u2019s say one of your item has 20 features, many of which are similar to other products in the market but some of which are different. These don\u2019t make much sense until you take advantage of the unique features to talk about the benefits your customers will get using your product with such advancing functionalities.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Use Call To Action<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each page on your website should be designed to serve a specific purpose and navigate users towards a desired action. In such situation, the presence of Call To Action (CTA) is to finalize the our navigation. CTA can be in the form of a link or a button, however; the latter is preferred and easier to draw the attention of readers. How to create good copy for these CTA buttons that optimize the click through rate and where to put them in a page are the concerns to provoke an immediate response from users. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8305\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/CTA.png\" alt=\"conversion rates - call to action\" width=\"629\" height=\"220\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A CTA is usually an action verb that creates a sense of urgency like \u201cShop Now\u201d, \u201cBuy Today\u201d or \u201cLearn More\u201d. The length of text should be short.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, pay attention to CTA colors of button and text. Each color has a unique meaning and evoke different feelings, and also choose the color that is in harmony with other elements in the page. CTA text should be a bit bigger than other text in the page to capture attention. In order to make your CTA button catch the eye, create a sufficient space around it to make it outstanding from the rest.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Offer proof<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People won\u2019t trust whatever you claim on your website if it seems unreliable. Therefore, information posted on your site should be backed up with sources.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Testimonials: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer reviews and ratings for your products should come from real customers and about the real experience they had. Internet users are clever and they can realize if such testimonials are real or just made up by your content team.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Social proof: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a great way to show visitors how many customers have bought and used your products. The more customers you have, the easier it might be to persuade potential customers to buy products from your company.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Case studies:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Real experience shared by other customers is the best evidence to show how your products benefit customers with their business.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Create relationship with customers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many visitors, they don\u2019t buy your products the first time they visit your site. Asking visitors for the purchase too fast might cause you to lose many sales. Especially, for high value products that request a thorough research process, you need to give your customers more time to make the final decision. To turn these visitors into your customers, it\u2019s a need to establish a good engagement with them, make them commit and trust your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For digital products, a demo version or free trial that allows users to try your products before purchase is a good idea to improve conversion. Besides, a blog with helpful articles providing insightful information about the industry and products is another engagement method to build trust of users in your site. Sometimes, sales do not come immediately, but require time and communication effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Easy &amp; smooth checkout<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the extreme convenience the Internet offers to its users, customers nowadays are becoming less patient. What does this have to do with conversion optimization?

The first is to have a clear instruction, guiding what customers have to do in each step. As mentioned, people are very easy to give up complicated process. Once customers enter this flow, it\u2019s not recommended that they have to figure out themselves how to purchase from you. The second point is to make users fill in as few fields as possible. In your signup form, instead of asking a lot of different fields, just request important information that you will ever need for further engagement. Signup via Facebook, Twitter, or Google account is another good choice to simplify the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8304\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/checkout1.png\" alt=\"conversion rates - easy checkout\" width=\"425\" height=\"301\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. Refund guarantee<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People tend to be more willing to pay for your products if they can return and get the refund in case the products do not meet their expectation or something went wrong. Make sure the refund policy is well communicated so that your site visitors would feel more secure going with your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9. Sell more with Upsell &amp; Cross sell<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upselling and Cross selling are to encourage your customers to buy more based on the previously purchased items. If done smartly, these methods can increase your revenue. Particularly, when a customer buys an item, your website will recommend related products that the customer might be interested in. Moreover, offering money-saving product packages can motivate people to buy more and as a result, you get more out of an average customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8308\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/upsell-amazon.jpg\" alt=\"conversion rates - Upsell\" width=\"768\" height=\"447\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, above all, customer experience is what that matters, so make sure these tactics are carried out carefully and are relevant to the items they relate to. Otherwise, customers will find your product recommendation irritating which might negatively affect their purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10. Visitor retargeting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To recapture visitors that almost become your customers is an effective method to optimize conversion rates. According to a research, 68.63% is the average cart abandonment rate of eCommerce stores. To win back a fraction of these visitors is a positive increase in your sales volume.

In this context, you can set up automation emails sent after a few hours of abandoned cart with a CTA to help them finalize their purchase right away. Another way to recapture almost conversions is ad retargeting. You can use Facebook ads or PPC ads to show the ads of your site to the visitors who had previously came to your website. By viewing these ads, visitors will be reminded of your site and likely to return to finalize the purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are 10 tips to increase conversion rates.

It also means the website is effectively designed in the way that attracts a great number of visitors to take the desired action, which, for most eCommerce sites, is to buy a product or service. As a result, the more visitors are converted into customers, the more revenue for your business.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While marketing strategies, such as SEO, Google ads, social marketing, try to drive more traffic to your website, conversion optimization plans play an important role in turning your site visitors into customers.<\/span><!--more-->\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To improve conversion rate on your website requires thorough research about user behavior when visitors explore your website. That said, there are tactics that encourage more and more visitors to become your loyal customers. This article will outline 10 tips you can carry out to optimize conversion rate.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. A\/B testing<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8307\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/split-testing.jpg\" alt=\"conversion rates - A\/B testing\" width=\"768\" height=\"401\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A\/B testing (split testing) is the method that you create different versions of your page with some tweaks and test to see which works better with higher conversion rates. Due to the fact that your audience is unique, what you think works well might turn to be a bad choice when it comes to your audience. Therefore, the best way to figure out what works well and what needs further improvement is to do A\/B testing.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To split testing, you can use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/1745152?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Content Experiments<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Google Analytics which is a free and easy to use tool.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8306\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/split-testing-in-Google-Analytics.jpg\" alt=\"conversion rates - A\/B testing\" width=\"600\" height=\"561\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, set up your goal and the percentage of traffic you want to send to experiment. Then input the destination URLs of the original page you want to test and of other variations. You will be given an experiment code to add to your original page. When all is setup, you\u2019re ready to run start the testing and see which is performing better.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Create urgency for immediate action<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Urgency notifications like \u201cThere\u2019re only 3 items left\u201d or \u201cThe last day to get the discount\u201d have proved to be effective in urging people to buy right away. When there\u2019s a specific deadline or scarcity for special offers, people will tend not to delay but take the buying process immediately for they don\u2019t want to miss out the chance.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, be careful to choose a proper type of urgency depending on your products or services. For example, if you offer digital products which never run out of stock, using the statement saying something like \u201c5 items left in stock\u201d is not gonna work and can cause reverse effect to your business.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Show the benefits<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8303\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/benefits.png\" alt=\"conversion rates - show the benefits\" width=\"799\" height=\"329\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A landing page that sells has not only good design but also excellent contents. Contents are what your customers will read and are your opportunity to persuade people why they should choose your products over the ones from other competitors. So, what are the key takeaways to create great contents for your website? Here are some:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Show value proposition:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What is value proposition? It is a statement of value you will give your customers. It convinces users how your products better solve and improve customers\u2019 problems than similar offerings. Having a specific value proposition will help differentiate your company from other competitors, show your uniqueness and strengths. Also, visitors will find it easier to understand your company, your products, and to determine how your offerings will help them improve the situations.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Great copy to make it easy to read:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Once you have set up your value proposition, deliver it in a way that all visitors can read it and understand easily. This is very important as they are your potential customers and the target you want to communicate with. If your messages are written in terminological terms that only economy majored people can understand, you have failed in delivering your values to a lot of potential customers.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>More benefits, fewer features:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Most importantly, people buy why you do it, not what you do it. This is consistent with the value proposition focus. Your customers are more interested in the benefits your products offer than the features. Let\u2019s say one of your item has 20 features, many of which are similar to other products in the market but some of which are different. These don\u2019t make much sense until you take advantage of the unique features to talk about the benefits your customers will get using your product with such advancing functionalities.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Use Call To Action<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each page on your website should be designed to serve a specific purpose and navigate users towards a desired action. In such situation, the presence of Call To Action (CTA) is to finalize the our navigation. CTA can be in the form of a link or a button, however; the latter is preferred and easier to draw the attention of readers. How to create good copy for these CTA buttons that optimize the click through rate and where to put them in a page are the concerns to provoke an immediate response from users. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8305\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/CTA.png\" alt=\"conversion rates - call to action\" width=\"629\" height=\"220\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A CTA is usually an action verb that creates a sense of urgency like \u201cShop Now\u201d, \u201cBuy Today\u201d or \u201cLearn More\u201d. The length of text should be short.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, pay attention to CTA colors of button and text. Each color has a unique meaning and evoke different feelings, and also choose the color that is in harmony with other elements in the page. CTA text should be a bit bigger than other text in the page to capture attention. In order to make your CTA button catch the eye, create a sufficient space around it to make it outstanding from the rest.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Offer proof<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People won\u2019t trust whatever you claim on your website if it seems unreliable. Therefore, information posted on your site should be backed up with sources.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Testimonials: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer reviews and ratings for your products should come from real customers and about the real experience they had. Internet users are clever and they can realize if such testimonials are real or just made up by your content team.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Social proof: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a great way to show visitors how many customers have bought and used your products. The more customers you have, the easier it might be to persuade potential customers to buy products from your company.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Case studies:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Real experience shared by other customers is the best evidence to show how your products benefit customers with their business.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Create relationship with customers<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many visitors, they don\u2019t buy your products the first time they visit your site. Asking visitors for the purchase too fast might cause you to lose many sales. Especially, for high value products that request a thorough research process, you need to give your customers more time to make the final decision. To turn these visitors into your customers, it\u2019s a need to establish a good engagement with them, make them commit and trust your brand.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For digital products, a demo version or free trial that allows users to try your products before purchase is a good idea to improve conversion. Besides, a blog with helpful articles providing insightful information about the industry and products is another engagement method to build trust of users in your site. Sometimes, sales do not come immediately, but require time and communication effort.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Easy &amp; smooth checkout<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the extreme convenience the Internet offers to its users, customers nowadays are becoming less patient. What does this have to do with conversion optimization? When a visitor has picked his favorite items and proceeded to checkout, make it as easy as possible for him to pay for the products.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some tips you can use to improve the checkout flow.

After getting your site up and running with such key functions, it\u2019s time you considered furnituring your site with supplementary features to attract more users. So this post is about additional features needed for a freelance website.<\/span><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advanced Search<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a basic function installed in almost online sites. Both project owners and freelancers need Search bar to quickly find their needs. They can search by keyword, filter by category or sort by different criteria, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Project Workspace<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having this function will increase working effectiveness between project owner and freelancer. The workspace is where the two will exchange messages, deliver the results, and manage the project progress by status.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this feature, project owner and freelancer can work and communicate right on your platform and there\u2019s no need to rely on other third party.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review &amp; Rating<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A drawback of working online is that we don\u2019t know the people we work with in person. Feedback system comes in as a reliable source for us to refer to. In a freelancing website, you need this feature available for both freelancers and project owners.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For project owners, reviews and ratings from freelancers they worked with might help other freelancers know their working styles, their attitudes and requirements. On the other hand, receiving positive feedbacks from many project owners is potential for freelancers in getting more invitation to bid in the future. To ensure the reliability of such feedbacks, make it only available for both parties to write review for the other when they finished a project.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dispute Management<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes things don\u2019t go in the way you want they to. Not all projects are completed successfully. There might be some reasons here and there causing freelancers to want to stop doing the projects or making project owners demand cancelling the job. So, in this case, you need to intervene in as a referee. Should anything unwanted happen during the project, project owner or freelancer is able to file a dispute to you. As a neutral third party, you will consider all the evidence provided to decide who wins and receives the money.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User Dashboard<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each user needs a private dashboard to manage his information on site. In this place, users can edit details of their profile, account, manage all projects, bids and messages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8354\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/08\/user-dashboard.png\" alt=\"freelance website - user dashboard\" width=\"768\" height=\"467\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notification System<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users are not online 24\/24 so they need notifications to tell them what happened while they were away. You can setup a notification bar on the website and also email templates to notify users important events like new project, bid invitation, dispute result, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customize Bar<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quick customize bar in front-end will help you conveniently change style and appearance of key elements on site, for example, header and footer color, body color, heading font, content font size.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8353\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/08\/color-style-picker.png\" alt=\"freelance website - customize bar\" width=\"375\" height=\"515\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Custom Sidebar<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides main content layout, sidebars are where you can flexibly arrange contents you want to show to users as a quick reference. WordPress themes can offer you with built-in widgets so that you can easily drag and drop any widgets to an appropriate sidebar.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Translation Support<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually, if not all, themes are displayed in English language. So translation is requested for websites writing in other languages. All contents on site will be listed in a section for you to translate theme into your own language.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a new theme version is released, there might be some texts added to site. A good theme will make the latest update of these additional contents in the list so that you can make an instant translation for your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plugin compatibility<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A premium WordPress theme could already integrate some popular plugins to make it even more advanced for your usage. That said, there may be many other plugins you want to install in the future. It is good to discover if the theme you\u2019re testing is well compatible to many different popular plugins.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check Out FreelanceEngine Theme<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FreelanceEngine is a premium WordPress theme making it easier than ever for you to build a freelancing website.

The workspace is where the two will exchange messages, deliver the results, and manage the project progress by status.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this feature, project owner and freelancer can work and communicate right on your platform and there\u2019s no need to rely on other third party.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review &amp; Rating<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A drawback of working online is that we don\u2019t know the people we work with in person. Feedback system comes in as a reliable source for us to refer to. In a freelancing website, you need this feature available for both freelancers and project owners.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For project owners, reviews and ratings from freelancers they worked with might help other freelancers know their working styles, their attitudes and requirements. On the other hand, receiving positive feedbacks from many project owners is potential for freelancers in getting more invitation to bid in the future. To ensure the reliability of such feedbacks, make it only available for both parties to write review for the other when they finished a project.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dispute Management<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes things don\u2019t go in the way you want they to. Not all projects are completed successfully. There might be some reasons here and there causing freelancers to want to stop doing the projects or making project owners demand cancelling the job. So, in this case, you need to intervene in as a referee. Should anything unwanted happen during the project, project owner or freelancer is able to file a dispute to you. As a neutral third party, you will consider all the evidence provided to decide who wins and receives the money.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User Dashboard<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each user needs a private dashboard to manage his information on site. In this place, users can edit details of their profile, account, manage all projects, bids and messages.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8354\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/08\/user-dashboard.png\" alt=\"freelance website - user dashboard\" width=\"768\" height=\"467\" \/>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notification System<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users are not online 24\/24 so they need notifications to tell them what happened while they were away. You can setup a notification bar on the website and also email templates to notify users important events like new project, bid invitation, dispute result, etc.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customize Bar<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quick customize bar in front-end will help you conveniently change style and appearance of key elements on site, for example, header and footer color, body color, heading font, content font size.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8353\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/08\/color-style-picker.png\" alt=\"freelance website - customize bar\" width=\"375\" height=\"515\" \/>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Custom Sidebar<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides main content layout, sidebars are where you can flexibly arrange contents you want to show to users as a quick reference. WordPress themes can offer you with built-in widgets so that you can easily drag and drop any widgets to an appropriate sidebar.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Translation Support<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually, if not all, themes are displayed in English language. So translation is requested for websites writing in other languages. All contents on site will be listed in a section for you to translate theme into your own language.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a new theme version is released, there might be some texts added to site. A good theme will make the latest update of these additional contents in the list so that you can make an instant translation for your website.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plugin compatibility<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A premium WordPress theme could already integrate some popular plugins to make it even more advanced for your usage. That said, there may be many other plugins you want to install in the future. It is good to discover if the theme you\u2019re testing is well compatible to many different popular plugins.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check Out FreelanceEngine Theme<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FreelanceEngine is a premium WordPress theme making it easier than ever for you to build a freelancing website.

It is especially the case for small and medium businesses since you can\u2019t do all the jobs by yourself. Freelancing websites have raised as a platform connecting project owners and skillful freelancers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re planning to develop a freelancing website offering this kind of service but haven\u2019t determined yet what features are needed, take a look at this article. There are 2 parts in this series; in part 1 I will go over core features to get your site up and running, then part 2 will introduce other additional features to help you build an advanced freelance website. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the key features in a Freelance Website?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key features in a freelance website are the most basic ones to make your site considered a freelance platform. Take some time to put yourself in freelancer\u2019s or project owner\u2019s shoes and think about their expectation of a freelance website. For example, freelancers would want to have \u00a0profiles to advertize themselves, while employers expect a project submission form in the front-end. And both would love to have project bidding function so that freelancers can bid for projects they love and employers can invite their favorite freelancers to bid. Considering the business side, a freelance website has to integrate monetization plans together with multiple payment gateways. Also, easy customization, responsive design, and SEO friendly are important features you should consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Project submission<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8320\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/project-submission.png\" alt=\"freelance website feature - project submission\" width=\"565\" height=\"531\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To trigger project owners to submit their projects, a submission form should be well designed and available in the front-end. In the form, employers should be able to input project name, the category it belongs to, its budget, project description, and spaces to attach any necessary files.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelancer profile<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8319\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/freelancer-profile.png\" alt=\"freelance website feature - freelancer profile\" width=\"1156\" height=\"491\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an online world where anyone can go anonymous, a profile with basic information about a person is preferred. Likewise, in a freelance website, a public profile for freelancers is a must-have feature to help project owners have the very first image about the freelancer they will work with. On the other hand, a vivid profile is a strong supporting tool to help freelancers with personal branding. So, what to expect in a profile? Besides information about name, nationality, skills, self description, freelancers should be able to upload their portfolio which is the most convincing evidence to showcase their professional expertise.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Project bidding<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8318\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/bidding.png\" alt=\"freelance website feature - project bidding\" width=\"581\" height=\"514\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is surely one of the most desired feature in a freelance website. Unlike micro services, projects are bigger in scale, outsourcing fee is higher, so employers need to consider and choose which freelancer to assign the task to. To do this, it is recommended that each project have the Bid button to let many freelancers bid for it. After that, project owner will choose the most appropriate candidate for the job. Moreover, project owners could also invite their favorite freelancers to bid for the projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help employers choose a good freelancer, reverse bid is applied where multiple freelancers will bid for a project and employers will pick the most suitable one. Any freelancers can bid for the\u00a0project and could know the bid values of each other. Employers will rely not only on bid price to choose a freelancer but also on other factors like freelancer portfolio, experience and skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monetization plan<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revenue generating methods are a vital part of every business. In a freelance website connecting project owners and freelancers, which plans can you use to earn money from your users? When looking for a freelance WordPress theme, check if multiple monetization packages are supported. There are several ways to charge your users, such as collecting commission fee per project on your website, charging freelancers for every bid they make, and making project owners to pay when they want to list their projects on your site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have a thorough research of the business model you will pursue and then pick up the theme that offers monetization plans that meet your strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different payment gateways<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flexibility in payment gateways help trigger your users to take on more transactions. Popular gateways like PayPal, 2Checkout or Stripe have wide coverage over many countries in different continents, which create utmost convenience for more users to join your platform. In case the majority of your users reside in locals where these payment gateways are not available yet, local methods should be integrated into your payment system.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fully responsive<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8321\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/Responsive-design.jpg\" alt=\"freelance website feature - responsive design\" width=\"1024\" height=\"417\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Responsive design is the current trend and it is certain that your site will lose many traffic if it fails to meet this expectation. People are going mobile more and more these days, making it extremely important to have a fully responsive site which runs seamlessly on every device not only desktop but also mobile phone, tablet, etc. Having all elements on your site run fast and are adaptable on any screen size is truly an advantage.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intuitive page builder<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a businessman who hardly has any coding skill and is on tight budget, drag &amp; drop feature to customize the website is a great solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check if any page builder tool (Visual Composer for example) is comes together with the theme, a front-end customizer is even greater. With this advantage, you can easily create, drag &amp; drop blocks and widgets to the positions you want to put them in page. This feature efficiently saves your time and effort since it requires no specific coding knowledge.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO friendly<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8322\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/07\/seo-friendly-image.jpg\" alt=\"freelance website feature - SEO friendly\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last but not least, an issue that every business cares about is how to bring more traffic to site. The last core feature has something to do with this which is being SEO friendly. A theme that is built with SEO friendly structure could significantly support your site in increasing rank in search results. Schema structure helps define your contents to communicate with search engines and social networks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FreelanceEngine theme is developed with all these features in mind to deliver a premium freelance platform for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[button type=&#8221;view&#8221; link=&#8221;https:\/\/www.enginethemes.com\/themes\/freelanceengine\/&#8221;]Check it out[\/button]<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Final thoughts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing this post, I hope to help you determine important features for your freelance website.

For two sides to come together, freelancers can bid for any potential projects and clients will pick the most suitable one for their projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having the intention of building a freelancing site, you must be wondering what steps you should take to realize your idea and bring it online. This is also the topic I\u2019ll be covering shortly. But before that, I will talk about freelance marketplace concept as well as niche markets for your business.<\/span><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bid-based freelance marketplace<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelance websites like Guru, Elance, and Upwork use reverse bidding as the operating concept for their marketplace. What is it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s first mention ordinary bidding (auction) in which buyers will compete by offering high price to get a good or service. The buyer paying the highest price wins. In reverse bidding, seller and buyer roles are interchanged. Sellers are the bidders. Buyers will consider among different bids and decide which to pick. The chosen seller doesn\u2019t need to be the one offering the lowest price.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, in a freelance site, when a client posts a project, multiple freelancers will bid for that project. Client will then pick up the freelancer he thinks is the most suitable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How this concept works on a freelance site?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8408\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/08\/freelance.png\" alt=\"How to Build a Freelance Bidding Website with WordPress 2\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first place, a client will sign up on your site and post a project with detailed description, requirements, estimated budget and time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, freelancers on site browse through the page and find this project. If they are interested, they can bid for the project, offer price and give estimated time of completion. Besides, the client can invite their favorite freelancers to bid for the project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Client will review each bid offer and have a look at bidders\u2019 profiles (portfolio, working experience, reviews and ratings on site).

For two sides to come together, freelancers can bid for any potential projects and clients will pick the most suitable one for their projects.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having the intention of building a freelancing site, you must be wondering what steps you should take to realize your idea and bring it online. This is also the topic I\u2019ll be covering shortly. But before that, I will talk about freelance marketplace concept as well as niche markets for your business.<\/span><!--more-->\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bid-based freelance marketplace<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelance websites like Guru, Elance, and Upwork use reverse bidding as the operating concept for their marketplace. What is it?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s first mention ordinary bidding (auction) in which buyers will compete by offering high price to get a good or service. The buyer paying the highest price wins. In reverse bidding, seller and buyer roles are interchanged. Sellers are the bidders. Buyers will consider among different bids and decide which to pick. The chosen seller doesn\u2019t need to be the one offering the lowest price.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, in a freelance site, when a client posts a project, multiple freelancers will bid for that project. Client will then pick up the freelancer he thinks is the most suitable.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How this concept works on a freelance site?<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8408\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/08\/freelance.png\" alt=\"How to Build a Freelance Bidding Website with WordPress 2\" width=\"550\" height=\"550\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first place, a client will sign up on your site and post a project with detailed description, requirements, estimated budget and time.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, freelancers on site browse through the page and find this project. If they are interested, they can bid for the project, offer price and give estimated time of completion. Besides, the client can invite their favorite freelancers to bid for the project.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Client will review each bid offer and have a look at bidders\u2019 profiles (portfolio, working experience, reviews and ratings on site). Based on such evidence, client will choose a suitable bidder and accept the bid. After that, he makes the payment which is held by site admin and will be transferred to freelancer upon project completion.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the project, client and freelancer can communicate and exchange information via private chat box on site. Website admin can control the project progress by management tools.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the project is finished, freelancers will get paid for their services.<\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose a niche market for your business<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may have the question that if the market already has many freelancing sites, why you should join in! Well, while above mentioned successful freelance bidding sites go global covering multiple industries in various regions, you can avoid the severe battle by going small. This is the strategy I think small and medium businesses should consider. The approach could come from two aspects: geography and industry. The former concerns with the range of regions where services are provided, whereas the latter is types of goods and services available on site. Normally, a broader range means more work, larger budgets, and more difficulty.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With some unique features, it\u2019s not an impossible mission for you to create an outstanding freelance website.

Project listings<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8506\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/09\/project-listings.png\" alt=\"freelancing business model - project listings\" width=\"398\" height=\"397\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a freelance bidding site, your main contents come from projects posted by clients. You can monetize this action by making clients pay to have projects listed. One way to do this is offering various packages, each of which allows for a number of projects posted and includes other add-ons. Paying by packages also reduces the hassle of payment made each time clients post a new project.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collecting fee per project listing is necessary as it helps ensure content quality. People won\u2019t spend money on posting untrue projects that have no value to them. On the other hand, this is a potential monetization method as you\u2019re able to capture a portion of all listings on site.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>2. Bidding fees<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8502\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/09\/auction.png\" alt=\"freelancing business model - bidding fees\" width=\"768\" height=\"401\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Project bidding is a typical feature of freelancing sites. It allows freelancers to bid for projects they have interest in while increases the chance for clients to find the best partner to complete the projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly to project listings, bidding packages are given for freelancers to choose. Each bidding plan has a specified number of available bids and other optional offerings.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a freelancing website where bidding is a key function, asking freelancers to pay for each bid is necessary. Why? Let\u2019s compare paid bid and free bid. Mentioning the former, each bid costs freelancers money which makes them consider carefully before bidding on any project. This makes each bid a real one, ensures the quality of the bidding. On the contrary, \u201cfree to bid\u201d alternative makes it so much easier for freelancers to bid on any project. There might be cases when freelancers bid and get accepted by clients but then quit, which is such a waste of time for clients. Unhappy clients are the situation you never want to deal with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, if you integrate bidding fee model into your business strategy, try to come up with a reasonable fee per bid, not too high but also not too low. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Membership fees<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8505\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/09\/membership-fees.png\" alt=\"freelancing business model - membership fees\" width=\"401\" height=\"401\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Membership fee is a user-based business model in which users have to pay a fee to become a client or freelancer on your platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The willingness to pay before getting any value from your site shows that users have serious intention of joining. Serious members possibly mean better quality and more popular reputation for your website. Specifically, clients have many valuable projects to list and freelancers are more skillful and professional.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, good points also come with challenges. To persuade users to join, you need to be able to prove that the benefits from working on your site far outweigh the cost. Freelancers would want to see the opportunity to work on thousands-of-dollar projects whereas clients prefer to employ the best freelancers who can excellently carry out all project\u2019 requirements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, as the nature of projects listed on freelancing bidding websites is quite complex, applying membership fee model on your site is a viable option.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Featured projects<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8504\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/09\/featured-projects.png\" alt=\"freelancing business model - featured projects\" width=\"398\" height=\"398\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your website reaches to the level of hundreds or even thousands of new projects posted everyday, it is quite difficult for a project to stand out from the crowd. It is when featured project comes in hand as a savior to draw more attention from potential freelancers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, alone featured project is not strong enough to be your main model. First, not all users have the urgent need of showing their projects on top of page. Second, this model might not prove powerful during the first days of site establishment when project listings are not plenty. Therefore, if you want to make this feature available, use it as a component of the main model. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Advertising<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8501\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/09\/advertising.png\" alt=\"freelancing business model - advertising\" width=\"768\" height=\"401\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is definitely a classic form of making money online. Browsing through the Internet, you have surely seen banner ads, pop-ups, video ads, etc. appear somewhere on any websites trying to grab your attention. That is how this model works to reach Internet users. When your website has attracted a high enough amount of daily traffic, advertisers will come to you to have their ads put on your site.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Onsite advertising has long been a popular money making technique but it is getting tougher than ever since most users don\u2019t like ads. Many apps have been used to block ads as users find ads annoying and irritating.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This business model is frequently employed on content platforms where users crave for information. However, on a freelance bidding site, users don\u2019t expect to see ads. Too many ads can lead to unhappy customers, which in turn reduces site traffic. So consider this model carefully.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>6. Commission fees<\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8503\" src=\"https:\/\/static.enginethemes.com\/2016\/09\/commission-new.png\" alt=\"freelancing business model - commission fees\" width=\"398\" height=\"396\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelancing bidding website is a two-sided marketplace whose value is created by the exchange between clients and freelancers. The ultimate result of this exchange is that clients get their projects done while freelancers earn money by providing skills to complete the tasks. To monetize from this exchange, commission fee is the widely used business model. You will charge a percentage or decent amount per transaction initiated inside the platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is commission fee the most popular model on the 2-sided platform? This is because it is triggered from the very core value, which is the transaction between clients and freelancers, your site provides for users. And this core value is the biggest reason customers need your platform. To get what they need, your customers are willing to pay for it. As long as you charge a reasonable commission rate, this business model is an assurance for long-term sustainability.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second advantage of commission model is that you won\u2019t miss out any transactions on your platform. The revenue, therefore, is higher than that of other models.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The challenge part of this model lies in its pricing level and structure: how much you should charge and how to distribute the burden between clients and freelancers. To come up with the final rate requires intensive research and depends on your business. Upwork has recently posed an example on this issue. In the past, the rate charged for clients and freelancers was 0% and 10% respectively. Now the game has changed. As the page explained that to reduce the burden maintaining the service, clients are required to pay 2.75% more over the top of each payment as processing fee, while the rate for freelancers varies from 5% to 20% depending on the project value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We can\u2019t say whether it is a proper change but this instance shows that to choose the right things to do is hard but it is even harder to do things right. This is also what I would like to say before ending this post. Building a business is a long run goal requiring great passion and hard work. But every problem has a solution. Choose the right business model for your freelancing website and apply it in the most effective way to achieve success.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Images by Freepik.<\/em><\/p>\n","post_excerpt":"<p>\u201cMake money online\u201d as a freelancer has increasingly been a popular choice among young people.
